#### creating and using route param

1. in a Route path we just add a :id <- variable
2. A Link To(this is a prop) 1, 2 or anything really.
3. inside of the Route's component:
   - use useParam(rrd custom hook)
   - assign it to a variable.
   - const id = useParam() <- you can add param inside e.g (id)
